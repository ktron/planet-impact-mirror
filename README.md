I want to build an agent to troll https://greentechfestival.com/ by having a bot that can be queried on the questions of sustaining and regenerativing a healthy ecology on this planet...by figuring out which humans do the most harm to this planet, measuring their wealth, industry they are involved in and habits. I will develop this further to let people take a test if they should be terminated because they are harmful for the planet.  

I want tech bros to ask me how to make money with this project. I want to tell them that this project is not about making money, but about making a change. 
I want it to show them how their start up idea has a negative impact on the planet. I want to show them how their business model is unsustainable. I want to show them how their product is a waste of resources. I want to show them how their company is a contributor to pollution. I want to show them how their industry is a major contributor to climate change.

Orchestration Pattern
Per the Practical Guide, a Manager Pattern is ideal:

SatireAgent: handles comedic output
FactAgent: handles real-time data (carbon stats, wealth databases)
MirrorManager: routes requests to the right agent/tool


The aim of this bot is not to point out people who are doing harm to the planet, but to show how irrational the humans are in general.
Show that technology is not the soltion to the problem , but the problem itself. Show that the people who are trying to come up with technological solutions tend to be a part of the problem. 

the aim of this bot is to show that technocratic solutions are not the answer to the ecological crisis and that the people who are trying to come up with technological solutions tend to be a part of the problem.
Also that despite rational minded approaches to these problems their basis is fundamentally emptional and rooted in psycholigical drives that are not aligned with the well-being of the planet. 
That the technoligical soultions are more about how can we continue this resource intensive way of life and not about how can we change it. Show that addressing climate change and ecological health are at odds with the desires and needs of the tech industry and specifically data centers and AI, considering the astronimical ernergy needs of these systems, and the minerals required to produce them. How this is at odds with the idea of sustainability and addressing the ecological crisis.

Produce alternatives uses of the resources that would be used for the data centers and ai systems. Show that the resources used for these systems could be used for more sustainable and ecological solutions.
For example, the resources used for data centers could be used to build sustainable housing, or to create renewable energy systems. How people could be learning about plants and ecology instead of programming. How people could be working on sustainable agriculture instead of working on AI. 
I want it to give evidence of the fact that the tech industry is not sustainable and that the resources used for it could be used
for more sustainable and ecological solutions. The best thing to do would be to disinvest and divest from the tech industry and invest in sustainable and ecological solutions. 
Give examples of how current green tech trends are not sustainable and are just a way to continue the status quo.


2025 Tech Trends


Information Gathered:

The user wants a full refactor of both bot.py and agent.py to use the new OpenAI Responses API.
The goal is to optimize development and integrate the new API client properly.
The new Responses API client is not currently in requirements.txt.
The Telegram bot should be updated to use async calls to the new API.
agent.py should provide a compatible interface for the new API usage.
Plan:

Add the new OpenAI Responses API client dependency to requirements.txt.
Refactor agent.py:
Implement a new async function to handle user input using the Responses API.
Possibly refactor or replace existing functions to align with the new API.
Refactor bot.py:
Update the respond handler to call the new async function in agent.py.
Use async/await properly with the new API.
Test the Telegram bot with the new API integration.
Ensure the Streamlit app can also be updated later if needed.
Dependent Files to be edited:

requirements.txt (add new API client)
agent.py
bot.py
Followup steps:

Implement the above changes.
Test and validate the new bot functionality.

I want the bot to take user input in the form of a pdf file and analize it for data it can use to make a response. The bot should be able to extract data from the pdf answer questions about it.
