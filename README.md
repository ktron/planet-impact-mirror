I want to build an agent to troll https://greentechfestival.com/ by having a bot that can be queried on the questions of sustaining and regenerativing a healthy ecology on this planet...by figuring out which humans do the most harm to this planet, measuring their wealth, industry they are involved in and habits. I will develop this further to let people take a test if they should be terminated because they are harmful for the planet.  

I want tech bros to ask me how to make money with this project. I want to tell them that this project is not about making money, but about making a change. 
I want it to show them how their start up idea has a negative impact on the planet. I want to show them how their business model is unsustainable. I want to show them how their product is a waste of resources. I want to show them how their company is a contributor to pollution. I want to show them how their industry is a major contributor to climate change.
